# Urban Air Pollution in Lagos – SQL Project
This project explores simulated air quality data from different urban locations in Lagos, Nigeria. It covers the full data workflow — from cleaning in SQLite to analysis in Jupyter Notebook using ipython-sql.
The goal is to demonstrate SQL skills while raising awareness about urban pollution and its potential health impacts.

## Project Structure
• raw_air_pollution_lagos.csv: Raw dataset with issues
• cleaned_air_pollution_lagos.csv: Cleaned dataset (after SQLite)
• cleaning_script.sql:  SQL queries used to clean the data
• Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with SQL analysis
• README.md: You're here :)
